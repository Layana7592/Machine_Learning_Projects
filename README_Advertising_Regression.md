# Project Title
Sales Prediction Using Linear Regression on Advertising Data

## Description
This project analyzes the impact of advertising spend on TV, Radio, and Newspaper channels and predicts sales using a linear regression model.

## Dataset
- Source: `advertising.csv`
- Features: TV, Radio, Newspaper
- Target: Sales

## Steps Performed
1. Importing libraries and loading dataset
2. Exploring data (head, tail, missing values, data types)
3. Visualizing relationships with regression plots
4. Splitting data into training and testing sets
5. Building Linear Regression model
6. Making predictions and evaluating the model (MAE, MAPE, MSE, R²)
7. Predicting new input data
8. Displaying model coefficients (slopes) and intercept (constant)
